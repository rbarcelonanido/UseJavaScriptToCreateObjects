**Program Overview**:

- This HTML document incorporates JavaScript to introduce "Pete The Pup," a character based on the American Pitbull Terrier breed, famed for his role in the comedy short film, "The Little Rascals." The script highlights two main approaches to creating and manipulating objects in JavaScript: using an object literal and a constructor function. Each method presents Pete's name, breed, claim to fame, and a playful note on his bark.

**Features**:

- _Object Literal_: Demonstrates defining a simple object with properties and directly displaying its information.
- _Constructor Function_: Shows a more dynamic way of creating an object with the ability to instantiate multiple objects from the same template.
- _Object Method_: Incorporates a method within the constructor function to display the dog's greeting.
- _Display Mechanism_: Utilizes document.write() to output Pete's detailed introduction directly on the webpage.
- _Structure and Implementation_

**Object Literal Creation**:

- An object named myDog is defined with properties describing Pete's characteristics and background.
Pete's information is displayed using properties accessed directly from the object literal.

**Constructor Function for Object Creation**:

- A constructor function Dog is defined to create dog objects with properties and a method myGreeting to output a greeting message.
A new Dog object myDogConst is instantiated, representing Pete with specified attributes and the ability to greet the webpage's visitors.

**Output**:

The document writes two greetings to the webpage, each representing Pete's introduction via the object literal and the constructor function, respectively.

**Technologies Used**:

- _HTML_: Structures the document and provides a canvas for JavaScript interactions.
- _JavaScript_: Implements the logic for creating objects and manipulating their properties to display Pete's information.
